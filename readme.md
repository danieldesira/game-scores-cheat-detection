# Game Scores Cheat Detection

Worker process in Python which consumes a Redis 
queue of game scores and compares them against a 
rule sheet in a file. Used for Mission Sea Turtle 
Nest but can be adapted to support other games in 
the future through simple architecture changes 
and adding JSON rule sheets following the existing 
pattern.

## Rule sheet structure

Please check out the following JSON document

``levelRewards``: Points awarding for passing 
the respective level. E.g.: 75 points for 
level 4.

``levelMaxInteractions``: Maximum number of 
interactions for characters that translate to 
positive scores. E.g.: Level 8 may not have more 
than 200 shrimp interactions.

``durationReward``: Contains information 
related to time-based reward systems.

``durationLimit``: Maximum time in seconds 
for the reward to be granted.

``reward``: Points awarded following a win 
in under the given ``durationLimit``.
